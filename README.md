Problem Statement
Contemporary platforms like LinkedIn fail at goal-conditioned discovery and credential integrity. Their architectures rely on user-declared profile metadata and classical graph traversal (BFS/DFS/PageRank), which are inadequate for large-scale, noisy, high-dimensional social graphs. These systems are inherently trust-centralized, lack cryptographic validation, and are vulnerable to Sybil attacks and credential spoofing.
Two Core Problems
(1) Inefficient Search: Users cannot query the network with semantic and structural constraints (e.g., "Find a robotics+climate tech investor with YC background reachable in 2 trust hops"). Traditional graph algorithms are computationally expensive and structurally blind to goal-conditioning.
(2) Unverifiable Identity and Claims: Credentials like affiliations or recommendations are self-issued. There’s no cryptographic binding between a claim and its signer, nor any way to prove possession/control over a claimed identity (e.g., email, ENS, org membership). Trust is monolithic and centralized.
Vera: Verified, Goal-Aware Search Layer
Vera introduces a multi-layer architecture to solve for semantic matching, trust-aware path routing, and cryptographic credential proof.
(1) Semantic Goal Embedding (LLM Vectorization)
User intents are transformed into fixed-length dense vectors using a fine-tuned Sentence-BERT or Instructor-XL encoder. The system captures multi-modal input (natural language goals + optional structured constraints), producing v_goal ∈ ℝ^d, where d ≈ 768–1024. Embeddings encode:
Intent vector → task-specific semantics


Constraint vector → token-weighted conditioning on features like geography, domain, affiliation


Latent traits → inferred soft signals (e.g., team fit, seniority archetype) from priors


These embeddings are stored in a high-performance ANN engine (e.g., FAISS, Weaviate, Qdrant) for fast cosine similarity search.
(2) Profile Similarity and Semantic Filtering
Each user profile is embedded via the same transformer pipeline: v_profile ∈ ℝ^d. The similarity function is defined as:
sim(v_goal, v_profile) = (v_goal · v_profile) / (‖v_goal‖ × ‖v_profile‖)
Results are pre-filtered via indexed metadata (e.g., location == "Toronto", industry ∈ {“AI”, “Climate”}), and then ranked by similarity. This produces a high-recall, semantically relevant candidate set C ⊆ V.
3) Quantum-Accelerated Trust Path Search
We formalize the search as:
Given G = (V, E), a semantic goal vector v_goal, and trust threshold θ, find v ∈ V s.t. sim(v_goal, embedding(v)) ≥ θ ∧ trust_path(u → v) ∈ T, where T is the set of valid paths with minimum trust decay.
Quantum Embedding
Each user node v ∈ V is mapped into a quantum superposition register using amplitude encoding:
|ψ⟩ = ∑_{i=1}^{N} α_i |v_i⟩,  where α_i encodes profile metadata amplitude
The user-defined goal function f(v) is embedded into a quantum oracle O_f such that:
O_f: |v⟩ → (-1)^f(v) |v⟩, where  
f(v) = 1 ⇔ (cos_sim(v, v_goal) ≥ θ) ∧ trust_path(u → v) exists
The oracle is constructed as a composite gate network:
U_sim estimates cosine similarity using quantum inner product approximation


U_trust verifies existence of a trusted path (e.g., using quantum walk encoding or QRAM-assisted bitstrings representing E)


U_f = U_trust ∘ U_sim — single-qubit-controlled phase-flip for all satisfying v


Using Grover’s Diffusion Operator and iterative amplification, the solution converges in O(√(N/k)) time, where k is the number of valid goal-aligned, trust-connected matches.
Credential Verification via Web3 (Decentralized Identity Stack)
To ensure authenticity of profile claims, Vera uses the W3C Verifiable Credentials (VC) model layered on Web3 identity primitives:
DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers): Each user and issuer has a DID (did:ens:alice.eth, did:web:yc.com) anchored on-chain (ENS, Ceramic, or SIOP)


VCs: Claims (e.g., “Worked at OpenAI”, “YC S23 founder”) are signed JSON-LD tokens:


{
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:ens:nirek.eth",
    "affiliation": "YC",
    "role": "Founder"
  },
  "issuer": "did:web:yc.com",
  "proof": {
    "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2019",
    "created": "2025-05-01T19:23:24Z",
    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",
    "verificationMethod": "did:web:yc.com#key-1",
    "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiJ9..."
  }
}
Proof Verification: Issuer public keys are resolved via DID Documents. Vera uses a local or federated registry to fetch proofs and perform on-chain or zk-SNARK based verification of VC authenticity, non-revocation, and subject-key binding.


Sybil Resistance: Root trust is anchored via org-issued attestations, decentralized reputation graphs, and optionally ZK-attested liveness proofs (e.g., Gitcoin Passport, Worldcoin’s Semaphore, etc.).
